Creating a website to display my information and things I've worked on/experience.  Built to be continuiously added to as I get more done/more experience.

// For me
-Create repository [X]
-React [X]
-Design Homepage []
-Design About Me (resume style?) []
-Design Projects [] (soft copy done; finalized styling later.)
    -Java []
        -No real data, but made seperate page.  Finalize styling later.
    -Python []
        -No real data, but made seperate page.  Finalize styling later.
    -JavaScript []
        -No real data, but made seperate page.  Finalize styling later.
    -Figure out how I want to handle project layout (project page with navigation to each language?  Project page holds all projects?) [X]
-Design global navigation [X]
    -Finalize styling later.
-Create Homepage []
    -Homepage is created, but severely lacking.  Needs design and maybe more info?  Do I want to keep it simplistic?
-Create About Me []
    -Finalize Design
    -Make a sort of resume style?

-What other pages would be beneficial to add?
-What information do I want to display on About Me that doesn't contradict Projects?
    -Education?  Experience?  That kinda stuff, probably.
