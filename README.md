Creating a website to display my information and things I've worked on/experience.  Built to be continuiously added to as I get more done/more experience.

// For me
-Create repository [X]
-React [X]
-Design Homepage []
-Design About Me (resume style?) []
-Design Projects []
    -Java []
    -Python []
    -JavaScript []
    -Figure out how I want to handle project layout (project page with navigation to each language?  Project page holds all projects?) []
-Design global navigation []
-Create Homepage []
-Create Navigation
-Create About Me []
-Create Projects []

-What other pages would be beneficial to add?
-What information do I want to display on About Me that doesn't contradict Projects?
